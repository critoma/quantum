StrangeFX is a Java(FX) based Quantum computer visual editor.
It leverages the Quantum computer simulator software exported by the [Strange](https://github.com/redfx-quantum/strange) project.
Have a look at Strange to get started with the concepts.
The samples at [QuantumJava](https://github.com/johanvos/quantumjava) leverage Strange and StrangeFX to visualise circuits that are created programmatically.

StrangeFX also has a UI editor that allows users to create quantum circuits with a drag and drop interface.
